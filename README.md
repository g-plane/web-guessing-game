# Web Guessing Game

There're too many JavaScript and CSS libraries, but do you really know them?

This game is inspired by [JavaScript Guessing Game](https://github.com/samiheikki/javascript-guessing-game),
but its last update time is several years ago, while JavaScript and CSS ecosystem is still developing rapidly.

Compared to [JavaScript Guessing Game](https://github.com/samiheikki/javascript-guessing-game),
this game adds these features:

- Dark mode. (Based on your system preference)
- You can use radio to select answer instead of button without confirmation. (Button is default)
